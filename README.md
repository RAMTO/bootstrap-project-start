## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

At least version 8 of Node.js is required for project usage.

### Installing

After cloning the project, install dependencies running:

`yarn` or `npm install`


To start project:

`yarn start` or  `npm start`

## Step by step guide

The project is data driven, so most of the configuration will be made in _.json_ files

### General setup
[Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) is used as a template engine, so the main config file is in _src/data/data.json_. All the meta data is cofigurated from this file.
